Hone your test driven development skills solving the popular puzzle game

## Rules of Sudoku
Sudoku is played on a grid of 9 x 9 spaces.  The grid is broken into 9 rows, 9 columns and 9 3x3 squares.  
The player must place numbers 1-9 in each cell.  When completed, the solution must comply with the following constraints:
- A number cannot be repeated in a row
- A number cannot be repeated in a column
- A number cannot be repeated in a square

## Objectives of the Exercise
This exercise can be performed in one of several languages.  For each language there will be starter code for your Sudoku 
solver as well as a set of test cases that confirms your solver satisfies puzzles of all difficulty levels.  Your objective is 
to provide the necessary logic to solve sudoku puzzles.

## Supported Languages
* [Java JDK 17](./java)
* [Python](./python)
* [Go](./go)
* [Typescript](./typescript)

## Skills to be gained
While it is exciting to complete the final solution the real objective is to enhanace your skills as an engineer.  As you are performing 
the exercise give some thought to:
- Incremental - are you only tackling one concern at a time via your tests?  Note: if you go more than 5 minutes in between red/green/refactor cycles you probably doing too much at once.
- [YAGNI](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html) - Are you letting your design evolve according to the needs of the test or are you pre-optimizing your code for what you think you might need? 
- Refactoring - The third step in red/green/refactor.  There are a lot of opportunities to refactor in this exercise.  When should you refactor and how do you avoid taking on too much change at once?
- [Outside In vs Inside Out Testing](https://8thlight.com/blog/georgina-mcfadyen/2016/06/27/inside-out-tdd-vs-outside-in.html) - What's the difference between the two approaches?  Is one more appropriate than the other?  What do I prefer?
- Language Syntax - are you a java developer still afraid of streams (it's ok to admit it, many are)?  There is often multiple ways to acheive the same task in a language this is a good opportunity to explore these alternatives and form an opinion as to when to make use of the different types of syntax.
- Keyboard dexterity - are you relying too much on your mouse to do the coding.  Are there some new keyboard shortcuts you could learn to be more efficient?
